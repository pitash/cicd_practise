# ========================
# Automatic Steps Added by GitHub
# ========================

# Step 4: Post Git Clone
# -------------------------------------------------
# This is automatically added by GitHub after the "Git Clone" step.
# It's the "post" phase of the checkout action.
# It cleans up:
#  - Temporary credentials used for checkout
#  - Authentication tokens
#  - Temporary folders
# GitHub runs post-steps in reverse order of when the actions were run.

# Step 5: Complete job
# -------------------------------------------------
# This is also automatic â€” it marks the job as finished.
# GitHub does internal housekeeping here:
#  - Marks the job status (success/failure/cancelled)
#  - Saves logs and artifacts
#  - Releases the VM/container runner
#  - Updates the GitHub Actions UI
